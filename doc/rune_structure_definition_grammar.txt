Rune Structure Definition Grammar

This is the definition document for the grammar used to define rune structures through use
of the parsing mechanism.

RUNE_STRUCTURE := RUNE_SLICE ( NEWLINE RUNE_SLICE )*

RUNE_SLICE := ( RUNE_ROW NEWLINE )+

RUNE_ROW := RUNE_NODE ( "," RUNE_NODE )*

RUNE_NODE := "(" NODE_ID ":" NODE_DATA ")"

NODE_ID := ALPHANUM+
NODE_DATA := ( ALPHANUM+ | "(" NODE_DATA ")" )

ALPHANUM := ( LETTER | DIGIT )
LETTER := [A-z]
DIGIT := [0-9]
NEWLINE := "\n"
